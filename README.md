## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Sentiment analysis (SA) is a language processing technique in text mining field that uses a computational method to identify opinionated description and determine whether data is positive or negative. SA is usually performed on unstructured textual data on the Web which often carries users' attitude, sentiments and subjectivity to an entity, like a product or a movie.

These reviews are important to the business holders as they can take business decisions according to the analysis results of users' opinions about their products. I am interested in exploring this field to better solve realistic issues like making marketing plan based on the sentiment analysis from customers' reviews.

The source of data is [IMDb datase](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) to take you there., which provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing.
The following questions will be illustrated:
- What is the data like ?
- How to deal with the raw data ?
- How to build models to identify the results ?
- Which methods can we try to improve the accuracy ?
